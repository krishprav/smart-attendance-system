# Fixes Made to Smart Attendance System Backend

## 1. Fixed TypeScript Top-level Await Error
- Changed async/await pattern in index.ts to use promises with .then/.catch
- Updated tsconfig.json to use CommonJS modules for better compatibility

## 2. Fixed Face Recognition Database Query
- Updated column name in test-face-recognition.ts from `vector_encoding` to `faceEncoding` to match the actual database schema
- Changed the data type in the SQL query from `::vector` to `::float[]` to match how face encodings are stored

## 3. Setup PostgreSQL and pgvector for Face Recognition
- Checked that pgvector extension is properly installed
- Ensured Prisma schema and database fields are properly aligned
- Fixed the field name mismatch that was causing the vector comparison to fail

## Next Steps

1. Run the application with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test face recognition with:
   ```
   npx ts-node src/scripts/test-face-recognition.ts
   ```

3. If you encounter any additional issues:
   - Check the database connection settings in .env
   - Ensure Docker is running if using containerized PostgreSQL
   - Verify that the pgvector extension is enabled

## Debugging Tips

If you encounter additional TypeScript errors:
- Make sure you've run `npm install` to get all dependencies
- Run `npx prisma generate` to update Prisma client types
- Check for any type mismatches between your code and the Prisma schema
